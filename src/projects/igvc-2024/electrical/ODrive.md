# Odrive

## Overview

The ODrive S1s used on Horizon are high performance motor controllers for brushless DC motors. They are designed for robotics and automation applications, and are capable of driving a single motor each with a peak current of 100A. The ODrives are capable of controlling the speed and position of the motors, and are controlled using CAN Bus on Horizon. The ODrive project is open source, a detailed guide for use can be found on the [ODrive Documentation](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/).
