# Electrical Subteam - WIP

[[toc]]

## Overview

With Horizon, the goal was to produce a competitive robot to compete in IGVC while also creating a well-documented platform for the team to use as a guide on their designs in future years. In the past, components were used based on their use use in previous designs and what was around the lab. Starting with Horizon, the team wanted to start to use more well documented open-source parts and software. This would allow for a better passing of knowledge between the different generations of members in the club. 



## Main Changes From Previous Designs

Some of the main changes from previous designs that are included on Horizon are as follows
- Custom Control Board - *PCB built and assembled by members to control basic functions within the robot*
- NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano - *In place of a laptop, the Jetson Orin Nano is used for vision processing and movement commands*
- Brushless DC Motors & ODrive S1 Motor Controlers - *The team moved to brushless motors as they were more efficient and have a longer lifespan than brushed motors. This change brought in the use of a new motor controller in the ODrive S1.*
