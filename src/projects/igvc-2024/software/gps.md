[[toc]]

## Overview
Horizon must get within one (1) meter of GPS waypoints found along the course. To achieve this, a ZED-F9P module is utilized. Using the SparkFun GPS-RTK-SMA Kit. This GPS is capable of three-dimensional accuracy down to 10mm. Documentation on all parts of this kit including schematics, data sheets, and a GitHub repository can be found on the [SparkFun Website] (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18292). Along with that, there is an extensive Arduino library for reading and controlling the GPS can be found [on GitHub] (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_v3)
