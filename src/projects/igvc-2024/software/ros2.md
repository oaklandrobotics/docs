# ROS2

[[toc]]

## Overview 


## NAV2 

To create the path planning and visulization of the course, Horizon uses Nav2. This software is also open source, meaning publically avaiable [documentation](https://navigation.ros.org/).

## Gazebo

Gazebo is a simulation software included in ROS2 that allows the user to create robots, models, and worlds to interact with and simulate. Integrated into the software is also the ability to add sensors, like a depth camera, and simulate physics based situations. The user can also import CAD models if the rudimentary shapes provided are insufficent for the detail needed. Tutorials for using Gazebo can be found [here](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials)

## OpenCV

Horizon uses OpenCV, a library for computer vision. Mainly utilized for object detection and video processing, the library works with C and Python. There is much in terms of [documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/) and [tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html) to be found on the internet including non-offical spaces.
