# ZED2 Depth Camera

[[toc]]

## Overview

Horizon utilizes a ZED2i stero camera for vision purposes. The ZED2i is a depth camera that was desgined for outdoor use with built in sensors for metrics such as acceleration, temperature, and air pressure. These alongside the main depth camera functionality and the included [ZED SDK](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/release) make the ZED2i an invaluable piece of hardware in our software subsystem. Further [documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/get-started-with-zed) can be found on the stereolabs website.
