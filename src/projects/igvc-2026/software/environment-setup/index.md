# Environment Setup

## ROS 2

ROS 2 is an open-source communications middleware that allows various sensors, applications, drivers, etc., to communicate with each other in an organized manner. This is the main tool/library which we will use to create the software package for our robot.

Read the official documentation [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/).

## Installation methods

ROS 2 is supported on multiple platforms, but we recommend either using a native installation of Ubuntu or a containerized Docker environment, as these approaches are the most stable and easiest to support as a team. You can reference the official documentation (linked above) for alternative installation options.

Our recommended setup paths:
- [Native](./native-install.md)
- [Docker](./docker-setup.md)
