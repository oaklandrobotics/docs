# Minibot


## Introduction
The goal of Minibot is to teach new members the basics of robotics and programming. It is meant to be a simple robot that can be built quickly and easily by new members. The robot is designed to be small and lightweight, as well as being built with off the shelf electronics and an easily assembled chasis. (WIP)
